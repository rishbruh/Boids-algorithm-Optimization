## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

df_area <- read.csv("area vs fps - R.csv", header = TRUE)

#reading a data frame of the given dataset


#conducting one-way between-subject ANOVA on algorithm and fps
anovatest <- aov(df_area$fps ~ as.factor(df_area$algorithm), data = df_area)
  
summary(anovatest)

# Conducting Tukey's HSD 
tHSD <- TukeyHSD(anovatest)
print(tHSD)
# Tukey's SCI plotted
plot(tHSD)






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

df_boids <- read.csv("boids vs fps - R.csv", header = TRUE)

#reading a data frame of the given dataset


#conducting one-way between-subject ANOVA on algorithm and fps
anovatest <- aov(df_boids$fps ~ as.factor(df_boids$Algorithm), data = df_boids)
  
summary(anovatest)

# Conducting Tukey's HSD 
tHSD <- TukeyHSD(anovatest)
print(tHSD)
# Tukey's SCI plotted
plot(tHSD)



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
